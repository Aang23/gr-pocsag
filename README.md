gr-pocsag: a gnuradio embedded python block for sending pocsag messages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


This is the first pre-alpha test release of gr-pocsag, a embedded python block for generating and
sending pocsag message.

The gnu-radio companion example uses a hackRF to send a pocsag-message on 433.900 Mhz.

As this is the very first time I develop a embedded block for gnu-radio, this is pre-pre alpha code and can
probably be done a lot better, .. it seams to work so that's a good start :-)


The python code itself is located inside the "pocsag generator" epy_block.


Release-information:
Version: 0.0.1 (20180826)


This code is released under the GPL license.


Have fun!
